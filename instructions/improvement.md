### Future Improvements for the Project

This project will be further developed and improved in the future. Below are the planned enhancements and updates:

1. **Optional S3 Step**: The current implementation includes a step to practice loading data from Amazon S3 to Snowflake using Apache Airflow. In typical projects, data would be loaded directly from the source to Snowflake. This step can be skipped if not needed for practice purposes.
2. **GitHub Data DAG**: Develop a new DAG that extracts data from a GitHub repository and processes it on an Amazon EC2 instance. This will allow for seamless data synchronization and processing in the cloud.
2. **Additional Data Sources**: Expand the project by integrating more data sources, increasing the variety and volume of data available for analysis
3. **Implement Dimensional Modeling**: Design and implement a dimensional modeling schema, including fact and dimension tables, to enable more efficient querying and reporting on the data.
4. **Continuous Integration (CI)** Implement automated linting and testing to catch potential issues early in the development process.
5. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Leverage CD techniques to automatically create resources in Snowflake.
