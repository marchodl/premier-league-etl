1. **Set up an IAM user for your AWS connection in Airflow**: Make sure you have an IAM user with the necessary permissions. You will need the following credentials for your Airflow AWS connection:
`aws_access_key_id = XXXX`
`aws_secret_access_key = XXXX`
2. **Create an S3 bucket**: Set up an S3 bucket to store data from the API. We will store the data in CSV format.
3. **Configure the Snowflake role**: Ensure that your Snowflake role is properly configured with the required permissions to access your S3 bucket. Set up a trust policy with the information from Snowflake storage integration, and grant permission to access your S3 bucket.
